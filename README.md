# Smart Login System

This project is a simple registration system that applies CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) implemented using JavaScript.
It consists of three pages: a Signup page, a Login page, and a Home page that displays a personalized welcome message for the user.

Signup Page: Users can create an account by providing their name, email, and password.
The entered information is validated, and upon successful signup, the user's data is stored locally.

Login Page: Verifies user credentials against the stored account information. If the provided email and password match an existing user, the user is directed to the Home page.

Home Page: Displays a welcome message using the user's name retrieved from local storage. Users can also log out from the Home page, which redirects them to the Login page.
